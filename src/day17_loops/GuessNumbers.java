/*
    create a program to guess the secret number.
    flow will be as follows:
    define the secret number, hard coded
    ask the user to guess a number
    based on the guess tell them a message:

    if they guess higher than the number:
      too high

    if they guess lower than the number:
      too low

    if they guess the number:
      you guessed correctly

      -> this will stop the guessing flow

    Challenge: keep track of the number of attempts taken to guess right
